AWT packages for windowing and canvas graphics.



# Usage

# Extra credit

Possible items:
* Light source is arbitrary, though currently hardcoded at the negated unit
  vector of [0.3, 1.0, 0.5]. Lighting intensity goes to zero at back, not side,
  relative to source.

# Third-party credit

No external code was incorporated into this project.
